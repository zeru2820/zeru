					<p>Bagan (Burmese: ပုဂံ; MLCTS: pu.gam, IPA: [bəɡàɰ̃]; formerly Pagan) is an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar.[1] From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom, the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, more than 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone,[2] of which the remains of over 2200 temples and pagodas survive.</p>

					<h1>History of Bagan</h1>
					<p>Bagan was the capital city of the Pagan Kingdom, the first Burmese kingdom, from 1044 until 1297. Today the area is home to more than 2,500 Buddhist stupas, temples and monasteries – the largest and densest concentration of Buddhist monuments in the world – but at the kingdom’s height there were over 10,000.Most of Bagan’s monuments The Bagan Archaeological Bagan has also had to deal with numerous earthquakes over the years, some of which have caused extensive and even irreparable damage to temples in the area – notably the Bupaya pagoda, which was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1975. In the 1990s, the Burmese government once again carried out restoration works on many of these monuments, and once again the renovations were considered by the international community to have been irresponsible and damaging to the integrity of the area.</p><a href="#">See more...</a>

						<h1>Swe Daw Lay Su's Detail</h1>
						<p>Legendary King Anawratha is famous in Burmese culture. It is believed that once the king was presented with a relic of Lord Buddha. He placed it on the back of his sacred white elephant and at four locations, the elephant stopped. Seeing this as a sign, King Anawratha built a pagoda at each spot. Local legend has it that if all four sites are visited in one day then a wish will be granted. This full-day tour follows the path of the king’s legendary elephant.  Shwezigon, one of Bagan’s holiest sites, is one location. Another site is Tu sthen there is Tant Kyi Taung, perhaps the most exciting. Seeing fewer tourists than the others, this hilltop temple is the most remote and it is believed that Buddha himself once visited. This special tour also includes a stop at Nyaung U’s morning market.</p>
